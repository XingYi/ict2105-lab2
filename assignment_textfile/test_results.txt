Question: At  the beginning of  each  test  case,  ensure  that any prior versions of the app are killed (How do you do this?) and not simply in background.

Answer: There are 2 ways to kill an app residing in the background using the Google Nexus phone emulator.

First Method - Multitasking Screen
1) Tap on the third (square) button at the bottom right of the action bar.
2) Swipe a recent app to the left or right of the screen and its thumbnail will disappear.
3) Or click on the "cross" sign at the top right of the app thumbnail.

Second Method - Android's Settings Screen
1) First, open the Settings screen and tap the Apps category.
2) Scroll down in the list, select an app, and tap the Force stop button to end the app’s running process and remove it from memory.
