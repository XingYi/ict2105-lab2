Question: What are the lifecycle callbacks when the home button is pressed in ActivityOne?  Why?

Answer: The lifecycle callbacks are onPause() and followed by onStop() but there is no onDestroy() because the activity is still hidden in the background and residing in the memory.

As opposed to the "Back" button, it removes the activity from the memory, therefore the onDestroy() method is called.
