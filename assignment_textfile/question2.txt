Question: What are the lifecycle callbacks when the home button is pressed in ActivityOne?  Why?

Answer: The lifecycle callbacks are onPause() and followed by onStop() but there is no onDestroy() because the activity is still stored as background in the memory.

As opposed to the "Back" button, it removes (or pop) the activity from the stack memory, therefore the onDestroy() method is called.
